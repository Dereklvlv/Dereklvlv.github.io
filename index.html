      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is Derek Ladéroute and I am a highly skilled programmer and electronics technician with experience in various programming languages, such as Python, C#, C++, Html and Javascript. I have a passion for programming and have acquired most of my skills through self-directed learning, as well as my DEC in programmable electronics and robotics that I am currently pursuing at Cégep Gérald Godin.</p>
      <p>In addition to my technical skills, I also have experience in custom manufacturing with various materials such as aluminum, fiberglass, plastics, steel, and wood. My passion for 3D drawing and graphic design are also assets that I can bring to your company.</p>
      <p>Outside of work, I am an accomplished musician who plays the guitar and enjoys all genres of music. I am also constantly exploring the latest trends in technology.</p>
