## About Me

Hello, and welcome to my portfolio page! I'm a skilled electronics programmer with experience in robotics, automation, and assembly. I'm passionate about programming and have self-taught myself several languages, including Python, C#, C++, HTML, and JavaScript. Currently, I'm further developing my programming skills through a DEC in Programmable Electronics and Robotics at cégep Gérald Godin.

In addition to programming, I have expertise in custom fabrication and installation, working with a range of materials like aluminum, fiberglass, plastics, steel, and wood. I'm also skilled in 3D drawing and graphics design. When I'm not working, I'm a musician who plays guitar and enjoys exploring the latest technology trends.

I'm focused on continuous improvement, always seeking new ways to develop my skills and tackle new challenges. I'm confident that my technical skills, diverse experience, and creative passions make me an ideal candidate for any company in the field of electronics programming.
